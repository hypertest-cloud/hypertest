# Version 0.1.0

The initial release of hypertest introduces a cloud-first test distribution system that transforms how you run your test suites. Distribute tests across cloud infrastructure and reduce your entire test suite runtime to just your slowest individual test.

## Cloud-Based Test Distribution

Run each test file in its own isolated cloud function instance. Tests execute in parallel across your cloud infrastructure, dramatically reducing total execution time from minutes to seconds.

## Playwright Integration

First-class support for Playwright test framework through the `@hypertest/hypertest-plugin-playwright` plugin. Your existing Playwright tests work out of the box with minimal configuration changes.

## AWS Lambda Support

Deploy and run tests on AWS Lambda with the `@hypertest/hypertest-provider-cloud-aws` provider. Leverage serverless infrastructure that scales to zero when not in use, keeping costs exceptionally low.

## Plugin-Based Architecture

Extensible design with two plugin types:
- **TestRunnerPlugin** - Integrate different test frameworks
- **CloudFunctionProviderPlugin** - Support various cloud providers

## Two-Phase Workflow

Simple CLI commands for test execution:
- `hypertest deploy` - Build and push Docker images to your cloud registry
- `hypertest invoke` - Run tests in parallel across cloud functions

## Docker Containerization

Tests run in containerized environments built on pre-prepared base images with Playwright and all dependencies included. Ensures consistent execution across local and cloud environments.

## Artifact Collection

Automatic collection of test artifacts (screenshots, videos, traces) from cloud executions. Artifacts are stored in S3 and organized by run ID for easy access.

## Configuration System

Declarative configuration with the `defineConfig` helper:

```javascript
import { defineConfig } from '@hypertest/hypertest-core';
import playwright from '@hypertest/hypertest-plugin-playwright';
import aws from '@hypertest/hypertest-provider-cloud-aws';

export default defineConfig({
  concurrency: 30,
  testRunner: playwright({}),
  cloudFunctionProvider: aws({
    region: 'eu-central-1',
    functionName: 'my-tests',
    bucketName: 'my-artifacts',
  }),
});
```
