- **Redistribute** the software under the same license terms
- **Build applications** on top of Hypertest for your SaaS or self-managed products

## Key Restrictions

The license includes three specific limitations:

### 1. No Hosted Service Offering

**What this means:**
- You cannot offer Hypertest-as-a-Service to your customers

- You CAN use Hypertest internally to test your own applications
- You CAN embed Hypertest in your own products for internal use

### 2. No License Key Circumvention

## Questions?

For more information about the license, see our [License FAQ](/license/faq).

## Why ELv2?

We chose the Elastic License 2.0 because it:

- **Protects the project** from being offered as a competing managed service
- **Allows broad usage** for internal testing, development, and integration
- **Supports the open community** by keeping the source code available
- **Enables modifications** so you can adapt Hypertest to your specific needs
- **Maintains sustainability** by preventing commercial exploitation without contribution

The ELv2 strikes a balance between open source principles and protecting the project's sustainability.
