# Version 0.1.0 - Initial Release ðŸš€

<string>Release Date: [TODO Add release Date]</string>
Welcome to the first version of Hypertest - a revolutionary TypeScript library that transforms how you run your test suites by distributing them across cloud infrastructure!

## Key Features in v0.1.0

### Plugin Architecture

Modular construction - application built from exchangeable segments (plugins/providers)
Configuration via hypertest.config.js - centralized management of all plugins and parameters
Hypertest Core - manages application flow and coordinates plugin operations

### Plugin Types

Test Runner Plugin - handles specific test libraries, prepares context and builds Docker images
Cloud Function Provider - delivers methods for cloud interaction (pull/push images, invoke cloud functions)

## Core Processes

### Deploy Process

Pull base image - pre-prepared container image that accelerates deployment
Build target image - combines base image with user project
Push to container registry - uploads image to selected cloud infrastructure
Configure cloud function - sets image for hypertest cloud function

### Main Hypertest Process

Generate Run ID - unique identifier for each hypertest process
Prepare payload - test runner prepares data for individual tests
Concurrent invocations - parallel test execution in cloud functions
Save results - test output stored in cloud bucket

## Key Benefits

### Massive Speed Improvements

Transform from sequential to parallel test execution
Total test suite execution time = time of your longest individual test

### Almost Zero Cost Infrastructure

Pay only for compute time you actually use
Cloud functions scale to zero when not in use
Costs just cents per run

### Plug and Play

Minimal configuration changes required
Integration with existing test frameworks

### Cloud Agnostic

Currently supports AWS Lambda
Prepared for future support of other cloud providers

## Technical Support

Currently Supported:

- Test Framework: Playwright
- Cloud Provider: AWS (Lambda)
- Runtime: TypeScript/JavaScript

Coming Soon:

- Additional test frameworks
- More cloud providers
- Summary report generation (currently in development)
