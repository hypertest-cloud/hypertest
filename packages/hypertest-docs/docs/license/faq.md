# License FAQ

Frequently asked questions about the Elastic License 2.0 (ELv2) as it applies to Hypertest.

## General Questions

### What does the Elastic License 2.0 allow me to do?

The ELv2 grants you a free right to use, modify, create derivative works, and redistribute Hypertest. You can use it internally in your company, integrate it into your CI/CD pipelines, and even embed it in your own products.

The only restrictions are:
1. You cannot offer Hypertest as a hosted or managed service to third parties
2. You cannot circumvent license key functionality
3. You cannot remove licensing and copyright notices

### Can I use Hypertest for free?

Yes! Hypertest is free to use under the ELv2 license. There are no usage fees, subscription costs, or hidden charges for using the software as outlined in the license.

### Is this an open source license?

The Elastic License 2.0 is a source-available license, not an OSI-approved open source license. While the source code is publicly available and you can modify and redistribute it, the restrictions on offering it as a managed service make it incompatible with the Open Source Definition.

We believe this approach provides the best balance between community collaboration and project sustainability.

## Commercial Use

### Can I use Hypertest in my company?

Yes! You can freely use Hypertest within your organization for internal purposes. This includes:

- Running tests for your applications
- Integrating Hypertest into your CI/CD pipelines
- Modifying Hypertest to fit your specific needs
- Using Hypertest across multiple teams and projects

### Can I build a SaaS application that uses Hypertest?

Yes, you can build and sell SaaS applications that use Hypertest internally for testing. The restriction is that you cannot offer Hypertest itself as a service to your customers.

**Allowed:**
- Using Hypertest to test your SaaS application
- Using Hypertest in your internal development workflow
- Embedding Hypertest in your deployment pipeline

**Not Allowed:**
- Offering "Hypertest-as-a-Service" to customers
- Providing hosted Hypertest instances to clients
- Reselling managed Hypertest infrastructure

### Can I offer Hypertest as part of a consulting engagement?

It depends on the specific arrangement:

**Allowed:**
- Installing and configuring Hypertest for clients on their infrastructure
- Training clients on how to use Hypertest
- Customizing Hypertest for specific client needs
- Providing support for self-hosted Hypertest instances

**Not Allowed:**
- Running a multi-tenant Hypertest service for multiple clients
- Offering hosted Hypertest infrastructure as a product
- Providing Hypertest API access to customers as a service

## Modification and Distribution

### Can I modify Hypertest?

Yes! You can freely modify Hypertest to suit your needs. You can:

- Fix bugs and make improvements
- Add new features
- Integrate with other tools
- Optimize for your infrastructure

If you modify the software, you must include prominent notices stating that you have modified it, and you must keep all existing copyright and license notices intact.

### Can I redistribute Hypertest?

Yes, you can redistribute Hypertest as long as you:

- Include the full license terms with your distribution
- Keep all copyright and licensing notices intact
- Distribute it under the same ELv2 license
- Do not offer it as a managed service

### Can I fork Hypertest on GitHub?

Yes! Forking is encouraged. You can create your own fork to:

- Experiment with changes
- Contribute back to the project
- Maintain a custom version for your organization
- Build specialized variants for specific use cases

Just remember to keep the license intact and comply with the three main restrictions.

## Specific Scenarios

### Can contractors or external developers use Hypertest on my behalf?

Yes. Contractors and external developers working on your behalf can use Hypertest as part of their work for you, as long as they're not offering Hypertest itself as a service to other clients.

### Can I use Hypertest in open source projects?

Yes! You can use Hypertest to test open source projects. The license does not restrict using Hypertest in testing workflows for any type of software.

### Can I include Hypertest in a Docker image?

Yes, you can bundle Hypertest in Docker images for your own use or distribution, as long as you:

- Include the license terms
- Keep copyright notices intact
- Don't distribute the image as part of a managed Hypertest service

### What about cloud provider marketplaces?

Offering Hypertest through cloud provider marketplaces (AWS Marketplace, Azure Marketplace, etc.) as a managed service would violate the license terms, as it constitutes offering the software as a hosted service to third parties.

However, providing installation scripts, templates, or guides that help users deploy Hypertest on their own cloud infrastructure is permitted.

## License Enforcement

### What happens if I violate the license?

If you use Hypertest in violation of these terms, your license automatically terminates. However, if we provide you with notice of your violation and you cease all violations within 30 days of receiving that notice, your license will be reinstated retroactively.

If you violate the terms again after reinstatement, any additional violation will cause your license to terminate automatically and permanently.
